Hello! I am a PhD student in Operations Research at [Columbia University’s IEOR Department](https://ieor.columbia.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Christian Kroer](https://www.columbia.edu/~ck2945/). My research focuses on problems at the intersection of game theory and mechanism design. Previously, I graduated with a bachelor of engineering in industrial engineering from the [American University of Beirut](https://www.aub.edu.lb/) with high distinction.
